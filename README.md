Content

Each of the folders (one per public participation process) contains the coded contributions of the respective dataset and the corresponding terms of use. The csv-file "dataset_location" contains the geo-locations (lat and lon) of the documents, the folder "files" contains the location phrase annotations (one WebAnno TSV 3.2-file per contribution). Location words are denoted with *, each span is identified by a unique number.

More detailed information on the definition of location phrases can be found in the paper.

More information on the WebAnno TSV File format can be found in the user guide at https://webanno.github.io/webanno/.
